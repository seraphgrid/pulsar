# Support.

- All of the scripts can be configured through config files in `configs`.

# Installation

- Install configs: `make install-configs`
- Install scripts: `sudo make install-scripts`

# Uninstallation

- Uninstall configs: `make uninstall-configs`
- Uninstall scripts: `sudo make uninstall-scripts`

# Keybindings

- Start sxhkd using command after installation.

`sxhkd -c ~/.config/pulsar/pulsar-sxhkdrc`

- If you want to include your existing configs.

`sxhkd -c your-existing-config -c ~/.config/pulsar/pulsar-sxhkdrc`

# Requirements

- `fzf` for tpulsar scripts (can be changed in `tpulsar.conf`).

# Development

- Editor should be vscode or geany (word-wrap disabled and tab -> 4 spaces).
